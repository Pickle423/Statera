##FAQ (We're lying no one's asked us anything):<br/>
Why is the prefix ?:<br/>
I don't know any bots that use it, and I don't feel like coding a selection option right now. If you have a conflict, your options are to cope and/or pick a side you yellow-bellied fuck.

Why is the slot functionality done with slash-commands, I hate slash-commands:<br/>
I hate them too, but I felt like it.

Your code sucks:<br/>
Yeah. We're both novice python ""developers.""

I hate this Fletch guy:<br/>
So do I.

It needs admin to create the channels, if you just want it for the music system use vexera or something idk. I wouldn't trust me either.
