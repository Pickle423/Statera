## Installation
To install it, your system needs the following dependencies on your project. Most of them can be installed with `pip` or the Python package manager of choice. The exception is `ffmpeg` which must be installed on your host as the Python package for ffmpeg is too old.

### Dependencies
- Python 3.8
- `ffmpeg`
- `nextcord`
- `PyNaCl`
- `python-dotenv`
- `youtube-search-python`
- `yt-dlp`

### Setup
Clone the project into a folder of your choice, enter it. In Unix it would be:

```shell
user@hostname:~ $ git clone https://github.com/Uncle-Sagbag/Kakapo.git
user@hostname:~ $ cd Kakapo
```

### Tokens
Tokens are sourced from `.env`. Create `.env` in the project folder.

```shell
user@hostname:~ $ nano .env
```

Paste the following tokens into your .env file. Feel free to change "example" to something else. Make sure you keep the quotation marks.

```
discord_token = "example"
user_agent = "example"
client_id = "example"
client_secret = "example"
redirect_uri = "example"
username = "example"
password = "example"
```

Press `CTRL+X` then `Y` to save the file.

### Execution
Running the bot is as simple as `python3 bot.py` inside the project folder. If that fails, make sure the tokens in .env are correct. If you want the bot to run in the background, install a package like `screen` or `termux` so there can be a terminal running in the background. Refer to those packages on how to set it up.
